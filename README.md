# 🎋 Intro

Welcome to the official repository of Advitya'24 Web, a React.js project that seamlessly blends design and functionality. This creation was inspired by my innovative work during the Meraki Club's UXquisite Hackathon.

# 📦 Tech Stack

- `Frontend:` React.js, React-icons and OpenSourced Component Libraries
- `Styling:` Tailwind CSS

# 👩🏽‍🍳 Features

- `Dynamic React Magic:` Leverage the power of React.js to ensure a smooth and interactive user experience.
- `Lightning-Fast Styling:` Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach for rapid and efficient styling.
- `Open-Source Components:` Utilize customized, open-source components aligned with my unique vision.
- `Adaptability:` Designed to adapt seamlessly to various dependencies.

# 💭 Process

The project journey involved a meticulous design process, drawing inspiration from my original work on Figma during the Meraki Club's UXquisite Hackathon. `Tailwind CSS` and `React.js` were chosen for styling and dynamic functionality. The project structure is well-organized, with key components like `App.js`, `Home.js`, `Navbar.js`, `Gallery.js`, `Footer.js`, and `Error404.js` contributing to the overall cohesiveness.
